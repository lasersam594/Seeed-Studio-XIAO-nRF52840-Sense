These are basic sketches for the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense (https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html).
Some of these will work with other nRF52840 boards.

I put these here because while it's almost certain that sketches like these have been out there for years, a Web search has real trouble
finding them, especially with AI. ;-)
