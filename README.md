These are basic sketches for the [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html).

I put these here because while it's almost certain that sketches like these have been out there for years, a Web search has real trouble finding them, especially with AI. ;-)

1. Seeed_Studio_XIAO_nRF52840_Sense_Sensor_Test1: Exercise most of the sensors with data and visual displays. (Coming soon.)
