These are basic sketches for the Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 Sense (https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html).

I put these here because while it's almost certain that sketches like these have been out there for years, a Web search has real trouble
finding them, especially with AI. ;-)

1. Seeed_Studio_XIAO_nRF52840_Sense_Sensor_Test1: Exercise most of the sensors with data and visual displays. (Coming soon.)
2. Seeed_Studio_XIAO_nRF52840_Sense_RGB_LED_Color_via_Bluetooth1. (Coming soon.)
3. Seeed_Studio_XIAO_nRF52840_Sense_Bluetooth_Send_Test1 (Coming soon.)

"Coming soon" because waiting for USB-C cable!!
